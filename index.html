      This is a tool for managing the hardware and software components of the different
      projects in a company. There is a PostgreSQL database where all the components are stored
      with all the necessary information about them. The access to the database is 
      restricted to the project managers and the system administrators. The main benefit of this restriction
      is that the names of the components can not be changed arbitrarily and hence a more structured workflow can be guaranteed.

      In this tool users can request components in  bulk , i.e. 20 or more requests can be 
      made at any given time. The requests are then processed by the system and the components are
      created in the Jira.
